# MBrew Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 2026-01-04

## Introduction
MBrew is a local desktop application built with Electron and Vue for craft beer recipe management and brewing assistance. We value user privacy and process data locally whenever possible. We do not upload or share user data to remote servers.

## Data Collection and Use
- We do not collect personally identifiable information (name, email, address, phone, etc.).
- We do not collect financial information, health information, contacts, photos/documents, or user-generated content.
- We do not collect device identifiers (e.g., advertising identifiers), location data, or sensitive information.
- Business data such as recipes, ingredients, inventory, and brewing records are stored locally on the user’s device (app data directory or user-selected file paths for backup/import/export).
- The app does not transmit such data to developer servers or third-party services.

## Third-Party Services and Network
- The app may access external documentation or project pages and check updates using HTTPS/TLS. No personal data is collected or analyzed.
- The app does not integrate third-party analytics SDKs (e.g., Google Analytics, Sentry).
- All external access is read-only for documentation or version checks and does not include user data uploads.

## Tracking Statement
- The app does not engage in cross-site or cross-app user tracking.
- No advertising or third-party tracking technologies are used.
- No data is shared with third parties for advertising or profiling.

## Permissions and Sandbox
- File Access: Read/write only when the user selects a path (compliant with macOS App Sandbox `files.user-selected.read-write`).
- Network Access: Used to load external documents or check updates (no user data involved).
- The app does not request camera, microphone, contacts, or location permissions.

## Data Security
- All data is stored locally.
- Backup/import/export uses JSON files; users manage storage locations themselves.
- We rely on system HTTPS/TLS for network transmission security and do not implement custom or general-purpose encryption.

## Children’s Privacy
- The app targets adult users in brewing management scenarios and is not designed for children.
- We do not collect children’s personal information.

## Changes
- If this privacy policy is updated, a new version will be published on the app’s homepage or project documentation.
- Material changes will clearly indicate the effective date and provide change details.
